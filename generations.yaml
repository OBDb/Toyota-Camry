generations:
  - name: "First Generation (V10)"
    start_year: 1982
    end_year: 1986
    description: "The first-generation Toyota Camry was introduced as a replacement for the Corona in Toyota's lineup, initially available as a four-door sedan and five-door liftback. This generation established the Camry nameplate that would eventually become one of the world's best-selling cars, though this original version was significantly smaller than later models. Featuring front-wheel drive—a departure from the rear-wheel drive Corona—the first Camry emphasized fuel efficiency, practicality, and reliability. Engine options varied by market but typically included 1.8-liter and 2.0-liter gasoline four-cylinders, with diesel options available in some regions. The interior was straightforward and functional, focusing on quality construction rather than luxury. Though modest by later standards, this first generation began establishing the Camry's reputation for dependability and value that would define the nameplate for decades to come."

  - name: "Third Generation (V30/XV10)"
    start_year: 1992
    end_year: 1996
    description: "The third-generation Toyota Camry represented a significant evolution, growing substantially in size and adopting different designs for different markets—the wider, larger XV10 for North America and Australia, and the narrower V30 for Japan and some other markets. This split reflected the Camry's increasing importance in the North American market, where the larger version was tailored to American preferences for roomier interiors and smoother rides. In North America, the Camry was available as a sedan or wagon, powered by either a 2.2-liter four-cylinder or a 3.0-liter V6, both offering improved refinement and performance. The interior quality took another step forward with better materials, more features, and increased sound insulation creating a quieter cabin. This generation solidified the Camry's reputation for reliability while adding a higher level of comfort and refinement, helping it become the best-selling car in the United States for the first time—a position it would frequently reclaim in subsequent decades. The third-generation Camry established the template of smooth, quiet performance, comfortable ride, and trouble-free ownership that would define the model's appeal for years to come."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (XV20)"
    start_year: 1997
    end_year: 2001
    description: "The fourth-generation Toyota Camry continued the model's evolution toward greater refinement and comfort, with North America now clearly established as its primary market. Featuring more elegant, rounded styling than its predecessor, this generation maintained similar exterior dimensions but offered improved interior space through better packaging. Available as a sedan or wagon (though the wagon would be discontinued during this generation in North America), the Camry continued with refined versions of the 2.2-liter four-cylinder and 3.0-liter V6 engines, the latter now producing up to 200 horsepower. The interior saw significant improvements in material quality and design, with a focus on ergonomics and comfort that helped position higher trim levels as credible alternatives to entry-level luxury cars. This generation further refined the Camry's reputation for smooth, quiet operation, reliable performance, and hassle-free ownership—attributes that resonated strongly with mainstream American consumers seeking practical transportation without drama or compromise. The fourth-generation Camry solidified the model's position as the benchmark for the mid-size sedan segment, forcing competitors to measure their offerings against Toyota's combination of quality, reliability, and value."

  - name: "Fifth Generation (XV30)"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The fifth-generation Toyota Camry featured more substantial styling with a taller, more upright greenhouse providing improved visibility and interior space. Available exclusively as a sedan in most markets (with the wagon discontinued), this generation grew slightly in most dimensions, reinforcing its position in the heart of the mid-size segment. Engine options included an updated 2.4-liter four-cylinder replacing the previous 2.2-liter, and a revised 3.0-liter V6, both offering improved performance and efficiency. The interior design emphasized user-friendly controls and improved materials, particularly in higher trim levels like the luxury-oriented XLE. Safety features expanded to include available side and curtain airbags, stability control, and improved crash structures. This generation maintained the Camry's focus on comfortable, trouble-free transportation while improving driving dynamics somewhat compared to its predecessors. The fifth-generation Camry continued the model's strong sales performance, particularly in North America, as it effectively delivered on consumer expectations for a practical, reliable mid-size sedan while adding incremental improvements in refinement, features, and value."

  - name: "Sixth Generation (XV40)"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2011
    description: "The sixth-generation Toyota Camry featured more angular styling and a focus on improved interior space and comfort. Available as a sedan in most markets, this generation maintained similar exterior dimensions to its predecessor while offering a more efficient interior package. A key development was the introduction of the Camry Hybrid, combining a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with Toyota's Hybrid Synergy Drive system, significantly improving fuel economy for the mid-size sedan. Conventional powertrains included an updated 2.4-liter four-cylinder and a new 3.5-liter V6 producing 268 horsepower—a substantial increase from the previous generation. The interior featured improved materials in most areas, though some critics noted instances of cost-cutting compared to earlier models. Safety technology expanded with standard stability control, multiple airbags, and improved crash structures resulting in strong safety ratings. This generation continued the Camry's reputation for reliability and practicality, maintaining its position as one of the best-selling vehicles in North America despite increasing competition in the mid-size sedan segment. The addition of the hybrid variant proved prescient as fuel economy became an increasingly important consideration for consumers, broadening the Camry's appeal to more environmentally and economically conscious buyers."

  - name: "Seventh Generation (XV50)"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2017
    description: "The seventh-generation Toyota Camry received a more comprehensive redesign with an emphasis on improved driving dynamics and more expressive styling to address criticism that previous generations had been too conservative and uninspiring to drive. Available exclusively as a sedan, this Camry featured more aggressive exterior styling with a bolder front fascia, pronounced character lines, and a more athletic stance. Powertrains carried over with updates, including the 2.5-liter four-cylinder, 3.5-liter V6, and hybrid system combining a 2.5-liter engine with electric motors, all offering improved performance and efficiency. The interior saw significant upgrades in design and material quality, with a focus on more premium soft-touch surfaces in most areas and improved technology including available touchscreen infotainment systems. A substantial mid-cycle refresh in 2015 brought even more aggressive styling with almost every exterior panel redesigned, representing an unusual investment for a mid-cycle update. This generation successfully maintained the Camry's traditional strengths of reliability, comfort, and practicality while adding more emotional appeal through styling and improved driving dynamics, helping the model maintain its sales leadership in an increasingly competitive segment facing pressure from the growing popularity of crossovers and SUVs."
